# Dotfiles

I'm always on the lookout for the latest and greatest in automation and
optimization. [pengwynn](http://github.com/pengwynn) and I put together [the
unofficial guide to dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io) to help everyone do
the same. If you have any tricks of your own that you'd like to share, let us
know on twitter - [@octodots](http://twitter.com/octodots).

## Setup

This "bare repo" setup is inspired by the article, "[The best way to store your
dotfiles: A bare Git
repository](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)".

## Installation

- `curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamyonk/dotfiles/master/.config/setup/init | bash`

## Credit

This project began as a fork of (and is heavily inspired by) [holman's
dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles), and much of it's ease is due to
him. Lots of tag-teaming with [pengwynn](http://github.com/pengwynn/dotfiles).
Some of the vim setup was borrowed from [skwp's
dotfiles](http://github.com/skwp/dotfiles).

## Share your dots
