# Dotfiles #

I'm always on the lookout for the latest and greatest in automation and
optimization. [pengwynn](http://github.com/pengwynn) and I put together
[the unofficial guide to dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io) to help everyone
do the same. If you have any tricks of your own that you'd like to share, let us
know on twitter - [@octodots](http://twitter.com/octodots).

## Topical dotfiles ##

Everything is built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Ruby" — you can simply add a `ruby` directory and put
files in there.

## Installation ##

- `git clone https://github.com/adamyonk/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `./script/bootstrap`

## Credit ##

This project began as a fork of (and is heavily inspired by)
[holman's dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles), and much of it's
ease is due to him. Lots of tag-teaming with
[pengwynn](http://github.com/pengwynn/dotfiles). Some of the vim setup was
borrowed from [skwp's dotfiles](http://github.com/skwp/dotfiles).

## Share your dots ##

tips and tricks for your favorite tools.
